+++
Frisson Waves project is a series of embodied concerts aiming to sharing frisson experience among the audience members.

### Project Description

Frisson Waves project is under the Cybernetic Being project supported by JST Moonshot([https://cybernetic-being.org/works/frisson-waves/](https://cybernetic-being.org/works/frisson-waves/ "https://cybernetic-being.org/works/frisson-waves/")).

When live performances deeply resonate with us, our bodies respond with physiological reactions - we call this phenomenon "frisson". However, while some people have a strong frisson response, not all people perceive these moments of mind-body dualism naturally. This ongoing research project aims to understand, share and augment how we experience frisson at classical piano performances.
