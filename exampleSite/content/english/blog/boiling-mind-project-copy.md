BoilingMind is an embodied performance project based on artistic practices and multi-disciplinary collaborations (Session House dancer team, HCI researchers, and wearable computing researchers).  We are guided by an interest in the link between performers and audience members, and the wider question of what makes live performance special.

### Project Description

There were one preliminary dance performance and one main final performance ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQeedSZU20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQeedSZU20 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTQeedSZU20")) presented as the artistic product. Both researchers and artists contributed to developing the concept during the iterative process to balance research and artistic interests. This process was mainly led by artists, especially the choreographer. Besides the predetermined story and design, the choreographer also created some improvisational sections where dancers could interact with stage elements affected by audience physiological response.
